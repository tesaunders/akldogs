# akldogs

akldogs contains data transcribed from Auckland Council’s annual Animal
Management reports relating to dogs and their management in Auckland.
The goal is to make this data more accessible to R users by providing
the following data tables:

- `dogs`: the Auckland dog population
- `owners`: Auckland dog owners
- `enforcement`: compliance and enforcement activities
- `impounds`: outcomes of dogs entering shelters
- `service`: Animal Management requests for service

## Installation

You can install akldogs from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tesaunders/akldogs")
```

## Data

Data is sourced from Auckland Council Animal Management [annual
reports](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/en/plans-policies-bylaws-reports-projects/our-policies/policy-on-dogs.html).
This package contains only the most relevant data for looking at dog
control activities. The way data has been reported over time by Animal
Management has changed, so please note the following

- A reduction in the known dog population from FY2017 to FY2018 is
  likely due to the removal of duplicate entries in the Auckland Council
  database.
- Where percentages are given instead of whole numbers, the numbers have
  been derived from the proportions and given to the nearest whole
  number, as is the case with some desexing data.
- Some data which is reported as split between multiple categories has
  been combined, as is the case with some desexing data, figures for
  roaming dogs, and figures for dog attacks on animals and stock.
- Numbers of Responsible Dog Owner Licence (RDOL) holders relates to
  owners, not the number of dogs which are registered to an owner
  holding a RDOL.
- The ‘unregistered dog’ data in `enforcement` can include proactive
  work, rather than just requests for service.
- ‘East’ team was added to the requests for service data from 2024, and
  some earlier teams were removed and the numbers added to ‘other’
  categories for the two priority types between FY2015-FY2017 and
  FY2021-FY2022.
